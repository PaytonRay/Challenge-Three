Challenge-Three

## Description

Well this project was definitely difficult for me. I definitely needed a lot of peer help and guidance to get me where the code is today. But I do now truly understand what I did write thanks to all those who helped me along the way! But what this program is for is creating a very secure random password. The use of this is very needed in today's world of people easily hacking into peoples info because their passwords are easy and have been reused on multiple sites. So this password generator is a 8 character to 128 character generator so if you really don't want anyone getting your information then this is for you!

## Getting Started

Now where to begin. Well to start I made global variables that's called the array of letters(Upper and lower case), numbers and special characters. Then I put a prompt when you press the generate password button on the page. That prompt then asks how long you would like the password to be. Then if you go under or over a certain amount you get a WRONG message. Then I made a function that either confurms or denies if you want certain questions that I asked in a prompt. Then after that it will create your password and randomize everything you wanted in your password.

### Executing program
SO to excute the program.
First: You will click the Generate Password button.
Two: You will then answer the prompts that will display on the page.
Three: Then after all proompts have been answered a password will generate for you to use!!!
